# Baku Engine
Baku Engine is primarily an early-stage interactive application and rendering engine for Windows. Currently not much is implemented, a basic renderer using OpenGL, but there is a plan to add a lot more.

## Getting Started
Visual Studio 2022 is recommended, Baku is untested on other development environments whilst I focus on a Windows build.
You can clone the repository to a local destination using git:
`git clone --recursive https://github.com/miguelaarrones/BakuEngine`
Make sure that you do a `--recursive` clone to fetch all of the submodules!

## The Plan
The plan for this engine is to learn. I'm trying to get a good grasp at how rendering engines work creating my own. This engine will have at least a 2D renderer, but I will try to implement a 3D one later on.
